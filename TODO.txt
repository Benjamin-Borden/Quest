Board:
    8x8 grid
    3 lanes -- width of 2 cells separated by "lane" of 
               one single unpassable lanes
    Cell types:
        - "Nexus": cells in first and last row (not including unpassable lanes)
                   spawn heros and monsters at start of game
                   when member of enemy team reaches opposite nexus, that team wins
                   contains market
                   > works the same as the previous market, can buy/spell
                     as many items as they want
        - "Plain": no special attributes
        - "Bush": *boost dexterity by 10%
        - "Inaccessible": same as before
        - "Koulou": *boost strength by 10%
        - "Cave": *boost agility by 10%
        * - boost persists every round the hero is in the cell 
        NOTE: in one cell, there can only be a max of 1 character per type
                (there can be 0 characters, 1 hero, 1 monster, or 1 hero & 1 monster,
                 but not 2+ heroes or 2+ monsters)

Gameplay:
    - team of 3 heroes controlled by player
    - team of 3+ monsters controlled by computer
        > 3 new monsters spawn at nexus (one for each lane) every 8 turns
    - Game ends when either a hero reaches monster nexus or monster reaches 
        hero nexus
    - ROUND:
        > player takes one action per hero
            + same four "fight" actions as before (attack, spell,
              change weapon/armor, use potion)
            + Move (wasd, and also b to go back to nexus)
            + TELEPORT (new - move to any cell in a DIFFERENT lane,
                provided it is legal)
            Note: legal moves are still wasd, only in accessible spaces,
                  but also now you cannot move past the monster in the
                  lane you are currently in, and you can go back to the 
                  nexus at any time
        > regain 10% hp and 10% mana at the start of every round

    - START OF GAME:
        > one hero on the nexus of each lane
        > one monster of appropriate lvl on the opposite nexus
          of each lane
        Note: alluded to bonus points for randomizing exactly which
              tile on the nexus
    - If a hero dies, they respawn on nexus
