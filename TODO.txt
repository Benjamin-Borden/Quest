TODO:
- check for valid move before moving hero on board (restrict when beside monster)
- fix when print statements are called 
    + "__ has died" when the character is not dead
    + location prints? "false H:3 W:7" for example
    + label printed hp after an attack
- print board after choosing heroes
- add spawn of monsters after 8 turns
- check if tile is already full before teleporting
- regain 10% health and mana at the start of each round (turn?)
- null pointer exception after killing monsters
- ensure when a hero dies they respawn on nexus
- monsters don't spawn on their nexus, they spawn on row 1?
- fix back bug where lanes 2 and 3 don't go where they're supposed to
- don't let them walk off the edge of the board (esp in lanes 1 and 3)
