TODO:
- check for valid move before moving hero on board (restrict when beside monster)
- fix when print statements are called 
    + label printed hp after an attack
- end game when monsters reach hero nexus
- regain 10% health and mana at the start of each round (turn?)
- null pointer exception after killing monsters
- monsters don't spawn on their nexus, they spawn on row 1?
- fix back bug where lanes 2 and 3 don't go where they're supposed to
- don't let them walk off the edge of the board (esp in lanes 1 and 3)
- Info counts as action bug

POTENTIAL FIX:
- move choosing the hero action to a separate method
        + PROBLEM: nullpointerexception
- would help fix checking for valid move before moving hero on board (can call validMove()
    and force player to choose a different option if move is not valid)
- would also help fix bug where hitting 'i' counts as a separate action
