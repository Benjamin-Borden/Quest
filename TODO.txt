TODO:
- *check for valid move before moving hero on board (restrict when beside monster &
    don't let the heroes walk off the board)
- printed hp after an attack -> add label for hero and monster to clarify who's hp is whose
- end game when monsters reach hero nexus
- regain 10% health and mana at the start of each round (turn?)
- null pointer exception after killing monsters
- monsters don't spawn on their nexus, they spawn on row 1
- fix back bug (see below)
- *Info counts as action bug

POTENTIAL FIX:
- move choosing the hero action to a separate method
        + PROBLEM: nullpointerexception
- would help fix checking for valid move before moving hero on board (can call validMove()
    and force player to choose a different option if move is not valid)
- would also help fix bug where hitting 'i' counts as a separate action

BACK BUG:
- the position index is incorrect, but when fixed, the initial spawn doe
sn't work correctly

print between spawn monsters and monster actions
2 - monsters receive dmg
i display monster Info
overworldfight.displayInfo()
